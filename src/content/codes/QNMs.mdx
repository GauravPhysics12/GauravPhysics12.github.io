## Black Hole Ringdown

Black holes are not completely silent. When perturbed—for instance, by an in-falling object or a merger—they ring with a distinct set of frequencies, much like a bell. These characteristic frequencies are known as **Quasinormal Modes (QNMs)**.

This project uses Python’s scientific computing stack (NumPy, SciPy) to numerically solve the wave equation for a perturbed black hole and determine the complex frequencies of its ringdown.
