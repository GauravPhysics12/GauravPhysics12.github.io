This project, proposed by my supervisor Dr. Nirmal Raj and published in *Physical Review D*, investigates a fascinating question: **What if "dead" neutron stars aren't truly cold?** While they cool down over millions of years, various mechanisms—like **dark matter capture** or **crust cracking**—could reheat them. These reheated stars would glow faintly in optical and infrared light, making them potential targets for powerful new telescopes.


## The Challenge: Hubble's Upper Bounds

Detecting the faint thermal glow of old, isolated neutron stars is incredibly difficult. Landmark studies using the Hubble Space Telescope placed **upper limits** on their temperature, confirming that they are extremely cold. This established a significant challenge: standard, old neutron stars are simply too faint to see. Our project aimed to determine if *reheated* neutron stars could cross this threshold of detectability.

## Our Approach: Turning Telescopes into Thermometers

Our plan was to calculate the maximum distance at which next-generation telescopes like **JWST, ELT, and TMT** could detect a reheated neutron star.

My primary contribution was using the **JWST Exposure Time Calculator (ETC)** to determine the observable flux for different scenarios. We found that for a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 and exposure times of 10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>, and 10<sup>6</sup> seconds, these telescopes could detect these faint objects from incredibly far away.

Using these flux values, we calculated the maximum observable distances.

## Finding Candidates

With our detection distances established, we knew that radio telescopes could easily pinpoint neutron stars within this range. Thanks to a powerful script written by my friend **Jasnoor Singh**, we were able to process data from pulsar surveys using a DM (Dispersion Measure) model. This allowed us to identify a list of known neutron stars with distances **less than 1000 parsecs**—our list of potential candidates for observation.

## Results and Publication

Our analysis demonstrated a strong scientific case for using future telescope time to hunt for these reheated neutron stars. The work resulted in a paper published in **Physical Review D**, which was also selected as an **Editors' Suggestion** and featured on the **IISc website**.

This work taught me a great deal about the realities of research; it’s not always a single "Eureka" moment, but a steady process of calculation, collaboration, and perseverance.

This was a pleasure to work on with one of the coolest professors I have met.
