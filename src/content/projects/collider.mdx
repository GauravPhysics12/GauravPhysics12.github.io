**Particle colliders are the most powerful microscopes ever built, allowing us to probe the smallest scales of nature. But buried in the vast amount of data they produce lie rare and potentially groundbreaking events. This project explores how unsupervised learning can help uncover such anomalies using jet image analysis.**

### Overview

This work focuses on developing a **machine learningâ€“based anomaly detection framework** for collider data, where the goal is to identify **rare or unexpected events** without explicit labeling.

The analysis pipeline consisted of the following stages:

- **Collider Event Simulation:**  
  Protonâ€“proton collisions were generated using **MadGraph**, followed by parton showering and hadronization with **Pythia**.  
  The detector effects were modeled using **Delphes**, producing realistic event outputs.

- **Jet Image Construction:**  
  Using **ROOT**, the reconstructed jets were converted into 2D images representing energy deposits in the detectorâ€™s Î·â€“Ï† plane.  
  These jet images form the visual representation of particle showers resulting from different processes.

- **Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection:**  
  A **Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)** was trained exclusively on background (QCD) jets.  
  During testing, **Top jets**, being rare and morphologically distinct, were effectively flagged as anomalies based on their **reconstruction error** (Mean Squared Error).

### Physics Context

Top jets are composite structures arising from boosted top quarks that decay hadronically, producing substructure patterns different from standard QCD jets.  
Detecting such rare events helps in:

- Testing **Standard Model predictions** at high energies.  
- Searching for **Beyond Standard Model (BSM)** phenomena.  
- Developing **robust anomaly detection frameworks** for next-generation collider experiments.

---

### Results and Insights

- The trained autoencoder successfully distinguished top jets from QCD background using the reconstruction loss as an anomaly score.  
- Visual inspection of jet images revealed distinct topological features between classes.  
- Quantitatively, the method demonstrated strong separation performance (e.g., AUC improvement over random baseline), showcasing the potential of unsupervised ML in collider analyses.
