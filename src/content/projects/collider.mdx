Particle colliders are the most powerful microscopes ever built, allowing us to probe the smallest scales of nature. But buried in the vast amount of data they produce lie rare and potentially groundbreaking events. This project explores how unsupervised learning can help uncover such anomalies using jet image analysis.

### Overview

This work focuses on developing a **machine learning–based anomaly detection framework** for collider data, where the goal is to identify **rare or unexpected events** without explicit labeling. The analysis pipeline consisted of:

-   **Collider Event Simulation:** Proton–proton collisions were generated using **MadGraph**, followed by parton showering with **Pythia**. Detector effects were modeled using **Delphhes**.
-   **Jet Image Construction:** Using **ROOT**, the reconstructed jets were converted into 2D images representing energy deposits in the detector’s η–φ plane.
-   **Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection:** A **Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)** was trained exclusively on background (QCD) jets. During testing, **Top jets** were effectively flagged as anomalies based on their high **reconstruction error**.
