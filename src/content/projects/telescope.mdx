When I was a kid, I used to visit a place called *StarGazing India*, where I met **Narendra Gor Sir** and **Nishant Sir**. One day, as a curious kid, I came across an old blue-covered book on how to make telescopes filled with strange figures, equations, and illustrations. I didn’t understand much of it, but something inside me said that one day I’d build my own telescope.

Talking with Narendra Sir, who had built his own telescope in the 1990s and continues to inspire countless students through science outreach — deepened that dream. When I was 12, I finally made my first **Galilean telescope** with the help of a local optics maker. It worked, but I wasn’t satisfied; I didn’t yet understand the *physics* behind it.

Years later, when I joined **IISc**, the thought returned. During a short summer break, I decided to make a telescope again — this time from scratch. I ordered equipment from the *Indian Astronomy Club (IAC)* and shared the idea with Narendra Sir and Nishant Sir. They immediately supported me, providing space, guidance, and encouragement.  

For 15 days, I worked nearly 10–12 hours daily, grinding by hand. The sound of grinding became rhythmic a steady heartbeat of patience and precision. Slowly, I realized I wasn’t just shaping glass, but **bending light itself**.

The experience taught me persistence and respect for craftsmanship in science. After returning to IISc, I began the **pitch polishing** phase with help from IAC. However, one mistake — leaving the pitch and mirror stuck together during a room shift left me with a “pitch–mirror sandwich.” Luckily, I managed to separate them without damaging the mirror, though the pitch layer was lost.  

The project is still awaiting completion, and I hope to finish it before my master’s concludes — to finally gaze at the stars through a telescope entirely built by hand.

Since I had just started using a tablet to make the logbook for my work, please excuse the rough sketches.
