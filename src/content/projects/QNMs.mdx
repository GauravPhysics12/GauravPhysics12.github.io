**Black holes are not completely silent. When perturbed, they ring with characteristic frequencies known as *Quasinormal Modes (QNMs)* — the natural vibrations of spacetime itself. This project explores their origin, mathematical formulation, and numerical computation.**

The study of QNMs provides deep insights into black hole stability, gravitational wave signals, and tests of General Relativity in the strong-field regime.  
In this project, I discuss:

- **Perturbation Theory:** How small deviations around the Schwarzschild metric lead to wave-like equations governing perturbations.  
- **Schwarzschild QNMs:** Derivation of the Regge–Wheeler and Zerilli equations describing axial and polar perturbations.  
- **Numerical Methods:** Implementation of boundary conditions and numerical integration to extract QNM frequencies.  
- **WKB Approximation:** A semi-analytic method to estimate QNM frequencies, useful for understanding trends across different potentials.

### Notes and Detailed Derivations

For readers interested in the detailed mathematics and derivations, the full notes are available below. These include a step-by-step treatment of black hole perturbation theory and the computation of QNMs.
