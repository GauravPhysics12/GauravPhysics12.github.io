Black holes are not completely silent. When perturbed, they ring with characteristic frequencies known as **Quasinormal Modes (QNMs)** — the natural vibrations of spacetime itself. The study of QNMs provides deep insights into black hole stability, gravitational wave signals, and tests of General Relativity in the strong-field regime.

In this project, I discuss:
- **Perturbation Theory:** How small deviations around the Schwarzschild metric lead to wave-like equations governing perturbations.
- **Schwarzschild QNMs:** Derivation of the Regge–Wheeler and Zerilli equations describing axial and polar perturbations.
- **Numerical Methods:** Implementation of boundary conditions and numerical integration to extract QNM frequencies.
- **WKB Approximation:** A semi-analytic method to estimate QNM frequencies.
