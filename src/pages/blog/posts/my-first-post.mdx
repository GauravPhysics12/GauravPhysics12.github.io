Have you ever looked up at the sky and wondered, “Why is it blue?” Or stared at a sunset and thought, “What a beautiful view, but wait, why is it so red and golden?”

Most of us have asked these questions at some point, maybe as a kid, maybe just last week. Well, don't worry, your nerdy friend is here to explain physics without throwing complicated equations at you. So let’s start with the classic:

## Why Is the Sky Blue?

Your first instinct might be, "Well, it’s the colour of the light in the sky.” That’s not totally wrong, but it’s not the whole story either.

Let’s think: what’s the most important thing the sky has? Right, the **Sun**.

The light coming from the Sun interacts with Earth’s atmosphere. And if you remember from high school (or maybe not), Earth’s atmosphere is about 78% nitrogen—fun fact!

Here’s what happens: when sunlight enters the atmosphere, it hits nitrogen molecules. You can imagine it like a game of billiards where photons (light particles) bounce off nitrogen atoms. When they collide, the light gets scattered in all directions.

Now here’s the cool part: sunlight isn’t just white, it’s actually made up of all the colours you see in a rainbow. Each colour has a different wavelength; you can think of a wavelength like the size of a wave in the ocean.

To explain colours, imagine:
- **Blue light** is like a ping-pong ball: small and easy to bounce around.
- **Red light** is like a beach ball: bigger and harder to knock off course.

Shorter waves, like blue light, carry more energy, which makes them much more likely to interact with air molecules. When they do, they scatter everywhere. That’s why the energetic blue light spreads out and fills the sky with its colour.

## What About Sunsets?

Who doesn’t love sunsets and the beautiful colours they bring to the sky? But have you ever wondered why the sky turns red? The reason is closely tied to why the sky is blue. It’s still about scattering.

During sunset, the Sun is low on the horizon. This means sunlight has to travel through **much more** of Earth’s atmosphere to reach your eyes.

On this longer journey, the shorter wavelengths—blue and violet—get scattered away so much that they don't make it to you. What’s left? The longer wavelengths: **red, orange, and yellow**. These colours survive the trip and fill the sky with warm, glowing colours.

There’s more: during sunset, the air near the ground often has more dust particles and pollution. These particles scatter even more of the remaining blue light, letting the reds and oranges stand out even more vividly. That’s why sunsets can look especially intense in a city with more air pollution.

### A Small Riddle

On Mars, the atmosphere has fine dust that primarily scatters red light away from the direct path of the sun. So… what colour are Martian sunsets?

*(Answer: They are blue!)*

### Conclusion

Today, you've learned the concept of **Rayleigh scattering**—the beautiful physics behind our blue skies and red sunsets. I hope you liked it, and next time you look up, maybe you’ll see the sky a little differently.
